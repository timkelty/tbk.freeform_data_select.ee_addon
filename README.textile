h1. Freeform Template Select

Creates selects populated by Freeform's templates or fields. Useful when managing forms as entries. 

Required/non-required field settings work as expected when using *Drop-down Select* mode. Current workaround for multi-select is prepending a valueless '--' option to clear field selections.
